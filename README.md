## Project description
Data is collected from the City of Melbourne's Census of Land Use and Employment (CLUE).  
Two Datasets are used to analyse available off street parking in Melbourne CBD.  
Parking data covers the period 2002-2020.  
The number of off-street car parking spaces per property is recorded in CLUE. 
Car parking can be classified as:
- Commercial: Car parking in a publicly accessible, paid parking facility
- Residential: Car parking in a residential building or property
- Private: Car parking in a non-residential building that is provided for use by staff, customers or visitors
